> *Back to basics. Forward thinking.*

Welcome to **dumbterminal.blog** – where we channel the simplicity of green-screen terminals and the wisdom of decades of computing evolution to cut through today's tech noise.

## What We're About

In an era of overengineered solutions and framework fatigue, we're here to ask the uncomfortable questions:
- Do we really need another JavaScript framework?
- Why did that npm package just phone home to three different servers?
- When did "simple" become a four-letter word in software development?

Named after the humble dumb terminals that once graced every developer's desk, this is our tribute to elegant simplicity and our gentle reminder to **stop doing dumb shit while coding**.
